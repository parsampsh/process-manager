# TODO

### 1. Add ability to create custom actions for the process
We need an ability to define custom actions for processes to send a specific signal to them.

### 2. Add resource usage monitoring
We need to add some stats about the resource usage of the process.

### 3. Write unit and feature tests for everything
We need to write automatic tests for every single feature that we have in this app.
It would probably help the development process.

### 4. Make it compatible with Windows
Currently it only works with UNIX based operating systems.
We need to make it compatible with Windows too.
